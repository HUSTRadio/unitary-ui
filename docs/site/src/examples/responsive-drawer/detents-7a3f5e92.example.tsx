              Drag the indicator or focus it and use Arrow keys to move between the 40%, 80%, and
              full-height detents; Home and End jump to either boundary. Dragging below the lowest
              detent dismisses the drawer. The snap uses the project ease-snap curve, and drag
              tracking itself has no transition so the panel stays under your finger.
