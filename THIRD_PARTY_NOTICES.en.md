infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You
under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or

if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated
by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally
appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only
and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices
within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to
the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution
notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to
the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,
without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above,
nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license

in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including
any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been
advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the
Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee
for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## Fonts (self-hosted tiered subsets)

All 15 tiered woff2 subsets under `public/fonts/` are copied to `dist/fonts/` and distributed with the npm package. None are covered by this repository's MIT license. The publisher has explicitly chosen to retain every processed font and disclose the differing risks below in the README.

### JetBrains Maple Mono

- Source: <https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono> / <https://github.com/subframe7536/Maple-font>
- License: SIL Open Font License 1.1 (OFL-1.1); copyright notices and the full license text ship as [`OFL-1.1.txt`](./OFL-1.1.txt)
- Usage: three weights across nine tiered subsets (latin / GB2312 level-1 / level-2), for code and terminal contexts
- Status: the license text ships with the package; modification, subsetting, and redistribution are permitted under OFL-1.1

### OPPO Sans 4.0

- Source: official OPPO brand font; the previously public page is no longer available, and no reproducible official public download/license page is currently known
- License evidence: retained official “free for commercial use” statement
- Usage: three tiered variable-font subsets (l1/l2/l3) ship with the npm package
- Risk: available public evidence does not fully cover subsetting, modification, and onward redistribution; republishers must perform their own legal review

### HarmonyOS Sans

- Official resource page: <https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/design/resource>
- License statement: HarmonyOS Font License (free for commercial use; modification, subsetting, and redistribution permitted)
- Usage: three SC Simplified / TC Traditional tiered subsets ship with the npm package
- Risk: the current resource page does not provide a license text fixed in this repository or a complete reproducible authorization chain; republishers must perform their own legal review

> Downstreams requiring a strict, auditable license chain should not directly redistribute these six OPPO Sans and HarmonyOS Sans subsets.
